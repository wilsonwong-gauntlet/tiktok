## Reimagining TikTok With AI

### Background
TikTok transformed how we view, share, and edit videos online. Not only did they pioneer short-form video, but they also made content creation more accessible to the masses through CapCut. The algorithm they created made "going viral" easier for even the new creator. You were no longer beholden to followers or subscribers—good content could reach the masses solely based on its quality.

But TikTok emerged in a pre-AI world. What if we could reimagine the platform with today's AI capabilities from the ground up? Instead of users spending hours editing videos, writing captions, or finding trending sounds, AI could transform raw ideas into engaging content. Rather than manually searching for content, AI could understand exactly what entertains each user. Today, we're rebuilding TikTok from an AI-first perspective, where intelligent agents enhance every aspect of creation and consumption.

### Project Overview
This two-week project challenges you to rebuild and reimagine TikTok with AI while leveraging modern AI tools and capabilities throughout the development process.

#### Week 1: Rapid Development (Due February 7 by 6 PM CST)
Use AI-first development tools (Cursor, Lovable, v0, Replit, or Windsurf) to rapidly build a functioning TikTok clone. This week focuses on practicing how AI can accelerate the development of enterprise-scale applications. Your goal is to create a solid foundation that you can enhance in Week 2.

#### Week 2: AI Innovation (Due February 14 by 6 PM CST)
Transform your clone by integrating AI features that enhance how users create, consume, and interact with content. With a working application as your foundation, you'll explore how AI can revolutionize the social video experience.

### Submission Guidelines
At the end of each week, you’ll need to submit the following to the GauntletAI LMS:
- A link to your project’s public GitHub repository.
- A link to the brainlift you used to learn, understand, and enhance the application with AI.
- A 5-minute walkthrough showcasing what you’ve built (and, where relevant, how you built it).
- A link to a post on X or LinkedIn showcasing what you’ve built.
- A link to the working deployed application.

#### Week 1: Rapid Development (Due February 7 by 6 PM CST)
Your first week focuses on building a streamlined version of TikTok using AI development tools. Choose one user type and build a complete experience for them.

### Choose Your Primary User
- **Content Creator:** Users who make and share videos
- **Content Consumer:** Users who discover and engage with content

### Specify Your Niche
Narrow your focus to a specific type of user within your chosen category:
**Creator Examples:**
- Fitness Coach sharing workout routines
- Chef demonstrating recipes
- Educator teaching concepts
- Musician sharing performances
- Beauty expert creating tutorials

**Consumer Examples:**
- Fitness enthusiast looking for workouts
- Home cook seeking new recipes
- Student learning new topics
- Music fan discovering new artists
- Beauty enthusiast learning techniques

### Define User Stories
Create detailed user stories for your specific user. For example:
**Fitness Creator Stories:**
- "As a fitness coach, I want to add exercise timestamps to my workout videos."
- "As a fitness coach, I want to tag videos with difficulty levels."
- "As a fitness coach, I want to categorize videos by muscle group."

**Recipe Consumer Stories:**
- "As a home cook, I want to save recipes by cuisine type."
- "As a home cook, I want to filter videos by cooking time."
- "As a home cook, I want to create collections of weeknight dinner ideas."

### Build Vertically
Build complete features for your specific user type. Each feature should work end-to-end before moving to the next.
For example, if you choose Creator:
- ✅ Complete video upload → processing → publishing pipeline
- ❌ Partial implementation of comments, likes, AND sharing

If you choose Consumer:
- ✅ Complete video feed → view → interaction flow
- ❌ Partial implementation of profile, search, AND notifications

Remember: A fully functional app for one user type is more valuable than a partial implementation trying to serve both.

### To pass week 1, you must:
- Build and deploy a working vertical slice
- Pick either creator or consumer
- Pick a niche within your choice
- Identify 6 user stories you are aiming to ship for the niche
- Showcase your functionality in your video and code
- Highlight your path, niche, and user stories in your walkthrough video
- Show working functionality that matches the 6 user stories you picked earlier

#### Week 2: AI Innovation (Due February 14 by 6 PM CST)
Your second week focuses on enhancing your vertical slice with AI features that meaningfully improve the user experience.

### Understand Features vs. User Stories
An AI Feature is a major capability that solves a user problem. Each feature enables multiple User Stories—specific ways users interact with that feature to achieve their goals.

### Choose Your AI Features
Select 2 AI features that:
- Address real problems for your chosen user type
- Integrate naturally with your Week 1 implementation
- Create significant value for your niche

### Define User Stories
Create at least 6 user stories across your chosen features. For example:
**Creator Example:**
**Feature: SmartEdit**
- "As a creator, I can say 'remove awkward pause' and AI edits out silence."
- "As a creator, I can say 'zoom on product' and AI adds zoom effects."
- "As a creator, I can say 'enhance lighting' and AI adjusts dark scenes."

**Feature: TrendLens**
- "As a creator, I get AI suggestions for optimal video length."
- "As a creator, I receive trending hashtag recommendations."

**Consumer Example:**
**Feature: SmartScan**
- "As a recipe learner, I can ask 'show sauce-making part' and jump there."
- "As a recipe learner, I can search for specific techniques shown."
- "As a recipe learner, I can find moments where ingredients are listed."

**Feature: PersonalLens**
- "As a recipe learner, I get recommendations based on my skill level."
- "As a recipe learner, I see content matched to my learning pace."

### Build Vertically
Build complete features for your specific user type. Each feature should work end-to-end before moving to the next.

### To pass Week 2, you must:
- Implement 2 substantial AI Features
- Define at least 6 User Stories across your features
- Show working functionality that matches these user stories in your video
